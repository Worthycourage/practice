        The narwhal, also known as a narwhale (Monodon monoceros), 
        is a medium-sized toothed whale that possesses a large "tusk" from a protruding
         canine tooth. 
         It lives year-round in the Arctic waters around Greenland, Canada and Russia. 
         It is one of two living species of whale in the family Monodontidae, 
         along with the beluga whale, and the only species in the genus Monodon. 
         The narwhal males are distinguished by a long, straight, helical tusk,
          which is an elongated upper left canine. The narwhal was one of many species 
          described by Carl Linnaeus in his publication Systema Naturae in 1758.
